# ðŸ’» Coding Projects

This repository contains my programming assignments and practice projects from various courses and labs.  
Most of these are written in **C++** and demonstrate my problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and application of programming concepts.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files

### Employee Lab
- **Description:** A lab project focused on object-oriented programming concepts, class design, and inheritance.  
- **Files:**  
  - `EmployeeLab.cpp` *(main program for testing Employee classes)*  

### Trigonometry Calculator
- **6TrigRatiosCalc.cpp**  
  - **Description:** Calculates all six trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, cotangent) for a given angle.  
  - **Key Concepts:** Math functions, user input validation, console output formatting.

### Root Finding Algorithms
- **RootFindingBisection.cpp**  
  - **Description:** Implements the bisection method for finding roots of a function.
